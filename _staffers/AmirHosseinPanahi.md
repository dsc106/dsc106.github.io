Hey everyone! I'm Amirhossein Panahi (you can call me Amir), a second-year PhD student in Data Science at UCSD. I'm passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems, particularly interested in machine learning applications in healthcare. In my free time, I love swimming and hiking, exploring new trails, and enjoying the beautiful outdoors. Looking forward to working and collaborating with all of you!
